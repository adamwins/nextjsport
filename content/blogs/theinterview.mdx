Ah, interviews. Everyone at some point has had to go through one, whether it be for a full-time job, internship, part-time job, or even some unpaid positions. Interviews can be stressful, and believe me, I have experienced that firsthand. Recently, I had an interview for a research assistant position, and I was terrified. The position sounded amazing—the opportunity to work with training AI models, learn about LLMs, and collaborate with professionals made me want the role so badly that I began to stress over the interview.

When the day of the interview arrived, I was filled with anxiety. Unfortunately, the interview did not go as well as I had hoped. I was so stressed that I couldn’t think clearly and ended up freezing. I used so many “uhms” that I cringe just thinking about it. It was not my best interview, and I still feel devastated about my performance.

However, these things happen, and I’ll make sure to learn and grow from this experience. While I may not have gotten the job, I’m thankful for the opportunity I was given and I won’t make the same mistakes again.
